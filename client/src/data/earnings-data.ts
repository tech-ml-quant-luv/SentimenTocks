      transcript: `Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Reliance Industries Limited's Q4 FY2025 earnings conference call.

I'm pleased to report that this quarter has been exceptional for Reliance across all our business segments. Our consolidated revenue for Q4 FY2025 stood at ₹2,35,000 crores, representing a growth of 8.5% year-over-year.

Our Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) business delivered robust performance with EBITDA of ₹15,200 crores. The petrochemicals segment benefited from improved demand conditions and our ongoing capacity expansion projects. Our refining margins remained healthy at $9.2 per barrel, supported by our complex refinery configuration and operational excellence.

The Digital Services segment, led by Jio, continued its stellar growth trajectory. Jio added 12.5 million subscribers this quarter, bringing our total subscriber base to over 450 million. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) improved to ₹181, driven by our tariff optimization and increased data consumption. Our 5G rollout is progressing ahead of schedule, with coverage now extending to over 5,000 towns and cities.

Retail segment achieved record performance with revenue of ₹68,500 crores, growing 15% year-over-year. Our omnichannel strategy and digital transformation initiatives are driving strong customer engagement. We opened 450 new stores this quarter and our digital commerce platform continues to gain traction.

Looking ahead, we remain confident about our growth prospects. Our new energy initiatives, including green hydrogen and solar manufacturing, are on track. We expect to commission our first green hydrogen plant by Q2 FY2026.

Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.21. We generated free cash flow of ₹18,200 crores this quarter, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities while maintaining our dividend policy.

We are optimistic about the future and remain committed to delivering value to all our stakeholders. Thank you for your continued support.`,
